# Outputs <br />
FHD outputs various data products, outlined and described below. Items marked with (!Q are currently not defined -- ask Ian if needed and update please!)<br />

## Beam <br />

### \<obsid\>\_beams.sav <br />

**beam_ptr**: a pointer to a pointer array of dimensions N<sub>polarizations</sub> x N<sub>frequencies</sub> x N<sub>baselines</sub>, which themselves are pointer arrays of dimension N<sub>UVresolution</sub> x N<sub>UVresolution</sub> to the appropriate hyperresolution uv complex beam model for that particular frequency, polarization, and baseline sampled at the uv resolution pixel. There is a one-pixel offset in the UV resolution for interpolation purposes. The final result is a vectorized image, where each slice has been concatenated into a vector that can be efficiently used in matrix multiplication algorithms.

### \<obsid\>\_jones.sav <br />

**jones**: structure containing the Mueller matrix information. Jones matrices are 2x2 matrices that relate the antenna responses to polarization directions on the sky. The Mueller matrix is the Kroeneker product of the Jones matrices. Mueller matrices are 4x4 matrices that relate the polarized visibility responses to the coherencies on the sky. They are direction-dependent: different directions on the sky have different associated Mueller matrices.
  * **inds**: long array; pixel indices relating jmat and jinv to directions on the sky
  * **dimension**: float; the number of pixels in the x-coordinate direction
  * **elements**: float; the number of pixels in the y-coordinate direction
  * **jmat**: 4x4 array of pointers. Each element is a pointer to a dcomplex array of length equal to the length of inds. Value (\*jones.jmat[i,j])[k] is the (i,j) element of the Mueller matrix at the direction on the sky given by pixel inds[k]. Each 4x4 Mueller matrix converts the vector [RR*, DD*, RD*, DR*] to instrumental polarization apparent sky [xx*, yy*, xy*, yx*] where R refers to the Right Ascension direction and D refers to the Declination direction.
  * **jinv**: 4x4 array of pointers. Each element is a pointer to a dcomplex array of length equal to the length of inds. Value (\*jones.jinv[i,j])[k] is the (i,j) element of the inverse Mueller matrix at the direction on the sky given by pixel inds[k]. Each 4x4 inverse Mueller matrix converts the instrumental polarization apparent sky vector [xx*, yy*, xy*, yx*] to [RR*, DD*, RD*, DR*] where R refers to the Right Ascension direction and D refers to the Declination direction.

Pointers and large arrays in **cal** structure:

This can be used in conjuncture with cal.uu, cal.vv, cal.tile_a, cal.tile_b, and the like to to find the visibilities associated with a specific time step. For example, to find visibility indices associated with the 20<sup>th</sup> time step, cal.bin_offset[19] specifies the start index and cal.bin_offset[20]-1 specifies the end index.

  * **cal.uu/cal.vv**: array of the light travel time in seconds for the U or V coordinate for each visibility. Visibilities are ordered by iterating through tile A for each tile B, and for each time step. This ordering is the same for cal.tile_a and cal.tile_b, and indices from cal.bin_offset can be used.

  * **cal.tile_a/cal.tile_b**: array of the tile index of the visibility, where tile A and tile B refer to the two separate tiles used in creating that visibility. This ordering is the same for cal.uu and cal.vv, and indices from cal.bin_offset can be used.

The amplitude and phase parameters are ordered by the least-degree to the highest-degree; a polynomial fit of A + Bx + Cx<sup>2</sup> has an array of three values A,B, and C. The mode parameters are ordered by mode in index units of the Fourier transform (can be a non-integer for the hyperfine DFT option), amplitude of the mode, and phase of the mode. The wave can be reconstructed by amp * e<sup>-i2pi*(mode*[0,1,2...n_freq-1]/n_freq)+i*phase</sup>.
